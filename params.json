Should work for 64 bits, but there is an `*.rpm` installer in official [Atom releases](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases) already.\r\n\r\n## Instructions\r\n- Download the [latest release](https://github.com/nelson6e65/fedora-atom-builder/releases).\r\n- Unzip that download.\r\n- Run the `run.sh` bash script.\r\n- If not errors, go to `dist` directory and install Atom with the `*.rpm` file generated.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ cd to/root/dir\r\n$ ./run.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou only will be asked for sudo privilegies when installing dependecies.\r\n\r\nYou can, instead, run task by task (useful to skip installation/update of dependencies when you already have):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Download and install all dependencies. You can skip this if you already installed \r\n# recently or you did it manually. You will be asked for sudo password. The first time \r\n# you should run this and the skip when you are updating:\r\nscript/install-dependencies\r\n\r\n\r\n# Get sources of atom to build. The first time will take some minutes, depending of\r\n# your Internet download. After first clone, the download time will be shorter. You \r\n# should run this always to get the latest stable Atom version:\r\nscript/get-sources\r\n\r\n# This will build atom sources and prepare the build of RPM installer. \r\n# Is mandatory run this:\r\nscript/build-sources\r\n\r\n# Now, you can build RPM installer:\r\nscript/build-rpm\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter success, you can use the `*.rpm` file to install Atom via `yum`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd dist/\r\nsudo yum localinstall atom-1.0.4-0.1.fc21.i686.rpm\r\n```\r\n\r\n> This instructions was tested in **`Fedora 21 TwentyOne`**, kernel `i686 Linux 4.0.8-200.fc21.i686`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
