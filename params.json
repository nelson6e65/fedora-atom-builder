Should work for 64 bits, but there is an `*.rpm` installer in official [Atom releases](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases) already.\r\n\r\n## Dependencies\r\nAs [Atom build requirement](https://github.com/atom/atom/blob/master/docs/build-instructions/linux.md#requirements), you will need **Node.js** and **npm** installed:\r\n- Node.js (0.10.x or above)\r\n- npm v1.4.x or above (automatically bundled with Node.js)\r\n    - `npm -v` to check the version.\r\n    - `npm config set python /usr/bin/python2 -g` to ensure that `gyp` uses `python2`.\r\n        - You might need to run this command as sudo, depending on how you have set up npm.\r\n\r\nIf you have not installed yet, you can check the [node installation instructions for Fedora](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions-1).\r\n\r\n>**Note**: Other dependencies will be installed automatically via `run.sh` (or `script/install-dependencies` task).\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nAfter install [Node.js](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions#installation-instructions-1) in your system, you can download Fedora Atom Builder using one of this options:\r\n\r\n### Option 1: Manual\r\nYou can manually download [latest release](https://github.com/nelson6e65/fedora-atom-builder/releases) and unzip it in any folder.\r\n\r\nThen, go to resultant folder, where `run.sh` bash script is.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd /path/to/fedora-atom-builder\r\n./run.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Option 2: Using Bower\r\nIf you already have [**Bower**](http://bower.io/docs/api/#install) installed in your system, you can use it to download Fedora Atom Builder and execute `run.sh` bash script:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n# Get the latest release (use 'master' to get the development version):\r\nbower install nelson6e65/fedora-atom-builder#latest\r\n\r\n# Go to the download directory\r\ncd bower_components/fedora-atom-builder\r\n```\r\n\r\n>Note: Bower requires `node`, `npm` and `git` installed.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nIt's simple: Just go to `fedora-atom-builder` directory where you downloaded and execute `run.sh`:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\ncd /path/to/fedora-atom-builder\r\n./run.sh\r\n```\r\n>You can also execute this command instead: `sh run.sh`.\r\n\r\nYou only will be asked for sudo privilegies when installing dependecies.\r\n\r\nAfter success, this will create a `*.rmp` file in the `dist/` directory.\r\n\r\n### Advanced usage\r\nYou can, instead, run task by task (useful to skip installation/update of dependencies when you are sure you already have installed):\r\n\r\n#### Install all dependencies\r\nDownload and install all dependencies.\r\nYou can skip this if you already installed recently or you did it manually.\r\n`yum` will ask you for sudo password.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nscript/install-dependencies\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Get sources of Atom Editor\r\nThis will download Atom sources.\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nscript/get-sources\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt will be used `bower` to get the latest stable Atom version. So, if you want to skip validations, you can run instead:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nbower install\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Build atom sources and RPM installer:\r\nThis is mandatory, obviously. After get atom sources and install dependencies, you ned to build installer:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nscript/build-sources\r\nscript/build-rpm\r\n```\r\n\r\nAfter this, you can install the `*.rpm` file in `dist` directory:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nsudo dnf install dist/atom-*.rpm\r\n```\r\n\r\n>Note: You may need to make ejecutable the files inside `script` directory to be able to run it directly.\r\n\r\n**Done! You have the latest Atom Editor updated in your Fedora! Easy :cake:.**\r\n\r\n> This instructions was tested in **`Fedora 24 TwentyFour`**, kernel `i686 Linux 4.6.4-301.fc24.i686`.\r\n",
